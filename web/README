Server interface:

/sync:

Called once per entity, taking a full entity description and either:

- Inserts a new entry if the entity doesn't exist and dirty is true
- Updates the database entry if it's out of date and dirty is true
- Returns a more recent copy if it's older than the stored one and it's not dirty
- Returns an error message

/mongoose?fn=sync&table=sync&entity-type=mongoose&unique-id=0&dirty=0&version=0&next:varchar=%22foodle%22&blah:int=20

/entity-versions

Returns a list of all unique ids and version numbers. Used to check for new
entities and ??? (provide list of newer updated ones to request?)
